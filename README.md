# ESP32_Blynk2.0_Projects 🚀

## Overview 📋
This repository contains projects demonstrating the use of ESP32 microcontroller with the Blynk 2.0 IoT platform. The main example project is **"Esp32_LedBlink_Using_Blynk2.0_App,"** which shows how to control an LED connected to ESP32 via the Blynk app using WiFi. 🌐💡

## Features ✨
- Control ESP32 GPIO pins remotely using the Blynk 2.0 mobile app 📱
- Demonstrates IoT connectivity with Blynk templates and virtual pins 🔗
- Simple LED blink control example using Blynk widgets 💡
- Code written in C++ using Arduino framework 🛠️

## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites ✅
- ESP32 development board 🧩
- Arduino IDE installed 💻
- Blynk 2.0 account (Register from [blynk.cloud](https://blynk.cloud)) 🔑
